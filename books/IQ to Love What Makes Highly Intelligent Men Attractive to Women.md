# IQ to Love What Makes Highly Intelligent Men Attractive to Women
- if a girl is interested in you, a daisy-shaped radar starts working in her head, catching all your moves, and turning them into a binary signal: “He loves me, he loves me not”.
- She wants to receive kindness and care only from a man whom she cannot just push around as she likes. Exactly like in sport, victory is as valuable as tough the opponent is.
- She will often prefer to keep it light, have fun, and take some time to figure it out.
- Do not go in for unreturned favors. She will be grateful but not attracted to you for that. For example, imagine she complains about her computer, and you know it will take some time to fix it. If she is your girlfriend, you can just fix it. But if you are trying to win her over, you should not offer her such a convenient free service. “Dating for Geeks” suggests saying something like this, “I can fix it. But then we will go to my favorite bar and you will buy me a beer!”

- It is not about you. It is about her. You must think from her perspective. Anything else simply will not work.
- It is not about you. It is about her. You must think from her perspective. Anything else simply will not work. Do not explain how much you want this relationship. She will not give you a chance out of pity. Do not try to convince her how great you are. She will not give you a chance on basis of your CV.

- So, when Annie starts with “you know, you are really nice …” he sighs deeply, interrupts her speech and asks her to close her eyes. Then he takes her hand and says, “The moment I saw you I knew: here she is, this is the girl I want to be with. You are a wonderful woman and you need to be loved. Please let me love you the way you deserve…”  When Annie opened her eyes and looked at him, she suddenly saw the most attractive man she has ever met.
